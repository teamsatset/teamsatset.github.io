  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>December 12, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to this application, which is developed and published by <strong>BuygenDev</strong>. By using any of our apps, you agree to the data practices described below.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information directly. However, third-party services integrated in our apps may automatically collect information such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (device model, OS version, IP address)</li>
    <li>Usage and interaction statistics</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (Google Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>Crash logs and performance diagnostics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our applications may use the following third-party services for ads, analytics, and essential app functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google AdMob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Ads</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services may use collected data to provide analytics, improve performance, and show personalized or non-personalized ads based on your consent and location.</p>

  <h2>3. GDPR Compliance (EU/EEA Users)</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you will be shown a consent dialog that allows you to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow personalized ads</li>
    <li>Choose non-personalized ads</li>
    <li>Opt out where applicable</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may change your consent preferences at any time through the app’s settings (if available).</p>

  <h2>4. CCPA Compliance (California Users)</h2>
  <p>California residents may opt out of the sale or sharing of their data. Our apps do not sell personal data, but advertising partners may collect identifiers for ad personalization. Selecting non-personalized ads reduces data usage.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our apps are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe data has been collected from a child, please contact us immediately.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use commercially reasonable measures to protect user data. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be published on this page with the updated “Last updated” date.</p>
